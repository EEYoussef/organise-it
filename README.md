How much time do people spend looking for little things in their homes or offices? Today many vendors offer a wide variety of standard home organising products. Many of these products come in different sizes, shapes, and designs, e.g., small drawer organisers or boxes for garage shelves. Buyers try to organise their living and workspaces with these products. Often, buyers get confused to choose from this variety to organise their living spaces. Even after they choose, the product might not fit the designated area, or it might fit loosely. Furthermore, even if the buyers manage to find the perfect fit product to organise a space, the items organised might not be easy to reach. Then, after all the time spent searching and deciding on the product, the buyer is left frustrated with their space unorganised.

Some people are talented at finding solutions to organise living spaces. Those talented organisers are quicker than others to find which products that suit certain spaces more than others. Some of these people would be willing to help those looking to organise their living and workspaces.



<Organise-it> App is specifically created to enable those who need to organise their spaces with talented organisers for a fee for their services. It enables people to organise their homes or offices without spending much time searching, deciding, and rethinking organising solutions for their living spaces. For example, if a person wants to organise their pantry, they upload photos of the pantry on the App through their account `post a project`. By doing so, they are asking others to help search which products are on the market to organise their pantry and how would these products fit their pantry. Here, the App would show a list of jobs to the organisers.  Then, the organiser searches for suitable products in the market and replies with an offer to the person who posted the job and the fee the organiser charges for their ideas. And it is up to the job poster whether to accept or reject. 
  ### \- Purpose

The purpose of the app is to provide help for people who do not have time to search the internet for hacks to solve their organising problems.It also helps people to find an efficient solution to their problem from the market around them. and also within their budget.

On the other hand, it helps people who are already gone through similar problems to share their experiences and earn some money.

through the marketplace, customers can find a quick, effective, and efficient solution to their mess with the agreed cost.

### R15.Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your *app*

### 1- Form Helpers

In the app, I used form helpers in many places In new/update  `Project`, `new offer`, and `project_outcome` I used them as an interface for users to input data, Using Form helpers allow me to have better controlling over the naming and attributes and by Using `form_with` I was able to use Ruby code to build an HTML form and bind it to a model. `form_with` provides a number of helper methods to generate form elements like input, text field, and others. these methods take a name as an argument which will be found in `params` in the controller and filled with the value the user entered in the field. and using  `:model` argument of `form_with` helped to bind the form builder object to a model object. so that the form's fields will be populated with the values from that model object when calling the form for an update.

 `form_with`  Uses POST or PUT depends on the object passed to it, if it has an id, form_with will use a PUT verb and the action path will be selected accordingly and the fields will be populated with the data from the model and the button will say update and the name of the resource . and if the object does not has an id the form will use a POST verb. and the fields will be empty and the submit button will say create followed by the resourse name.





```
<%=form_with model: @project, local: true do |f|%>

  <div class='form-group mb-3'> 
  <h5>
    <%=f.label :title, class: "form-label"%>
    </h5>
    <%=f.text_field :title%>
  </div>
   <div class='form-group mb-3'> 
    <%=f.label :description, class: "form-label"%>
    <%=f.text_area :description, class: "form-control"%>
  </div>
  <div class='form-group mb-3'> 
    <%=f.label :price, class: "form-label" %>
    :In Cents
    <%=f.number_field :price %>
  </div>


   <div class='form-group mb-3'> 
    <%=f.label :budget, class: "form-label"%>
    <%=f.number_field :budget%>
  </div>



   <div class='form-group mb-3'> 
    <%=f.label :pictures, class: "form-label"%>
    <%=f.file_field :pictures,:multiple => true, accept: "image/png, image/jpg, image/jpeg", class: "form-select"%>
  </div>


<div class='actions'> 
   <%=f.submit%>
  </div>

<%end%>
```



### 2- Active Records:

Using active records in the app to help in creating and using the objects that I want to store in the database for example: `User`, `Project`,`Offer`, `Project_outcome` and others.

by using active records I was able to make use of the automatically created methods for the CRUD which can read and updated and delete data stored in the tables.

For example:

`@offer = Offer.new()`

`` @project.update(project_params)`

`@project = Project.find(params[:id])`

I also applied some validation on the model so that the active record can check before writing on the database.

` validates :price, numericality: { only_integer: true ,greater_than:0,less_than:10000, messsage: "%{value} is not a valid size"  }'`

'`  validates :title, presence: true`



### 3- Active Storage:

For attaching pictures to the project I used `ActiveStorage` which facilitate uploading files and get these files to be attached to an Active Record object.

Active Storage uses three tables `active_storage_blobs`, `active_storage_variant_records` and `active_storage_attachments`. 

I attached many pictures to the project model:

`has_many_attached:pictures`



Storage on a server can slow the server down and also it is extremely expensive, it will cost a lot more than storing in a cloud service. and every time we update the app and rebuild the app will be slower if we store the images on the server. I used AWS S3 , and by uploading the keys in the credential file and declaring Active Storage service in `config/storage.yml`. I was able to allow users to upload pictures for the projects. and in upcoming updates, I will allow the option of attaching a user profile picture to the profile page.



### 4-Migration:

Using migration along with active record allows changes to the schema,Migration is a Rails domain-specific language for managing a database schema. Migrations are stored in files it is then can be run using `rails db:migrate to run against the schema in the application.

Example :a migration for creating a model project 

```
class CreateProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]

  def change

    create_table :projects do |t|

      t.string :title

      t.string :description

      t.string :budget

      t.integer :price

      t.references :user, null: false, foreign_key: true

      \# t.references :freelancer_user, null: true, foreign_key: true

      



      t.timestamps

    end

  end

end
```

another migration for changing columne in Offer

```
class ChangeColumnDefault < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]

  def change

    change_column :offers, :accept, :boolean, :default => false

  end

end
```





### R16.Detail any third party services that your *app* will use

#### Stripe: 

Stripe allows the app to have the payment system in a safe and efficient environment. So that the customer can safely transfer the funds for the freelancer through stripe.

And  Instead of handling the payment process details and card information in the app, Stripe handles all the steps between the customer and the freelancer. Stripe is SSL protected. where financial information such as credit card details, bank account numbers, passwords are duly encrypted and securely transmitted. It is also [PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant, so information is safe and secure.



#### Amazon AWS S3 service:

To efficiently store large amounts of photos I used AWS S3 which is simply a storage service that offers a cloud storage space where the app can retrieve any amount of data at any time and from anywhere. S3 is highly scalable and flexible.

In AWS I created a bucket to store the application photos used with the project and then using Active Storage I was able to upload the object to a bucket. When the object is in the bucket, I can then retrieve it anytime.

#### Devise:

 `Devise` is an authentication system that allows the application to authenticate users of the app. 
With `devise`, I was able to create a user that can log in and sign up and log out. as `Devise` takes care of all the code needed for creating user and user sessions. I chose to use `devise` for handling the authentication because it is more robust than encrypting and salting the password manually.

`devise` uses many models and helper methods to do the job one of the useful ones is `before_action :authenticate_user! ` which allows the application to limit access to an action unless a user is logged in.

another one is `user_signed_in?` which verifies if the user is signed.

and `current_user`  that returns an instance of the user doing the action.

#### Ultrahook: 

Ultrahook:

Webhooks it is an HTTP request where other servers/apps can send messages. When the user pay for the project using Sripe, that server then sends data to our server with that webhook URL. 

I used ultrahook to connect webhook endpoint with the localhost during development on the local computer. I used Ultrahook to test the stripe payment. Stripe sends out webhooks during payment, so in order to test it on the local computer I created an endpoint in Strip then connected it to  ultrahook . 

webhook is a way for one application to send data to another application. so strip is sending data to my application.

#### 



### R17.Describe your project's model in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

Complete discussion of the project’s models with an understanding of how its active record associations function

#### Project Models:

#### Users: 



![user_table](./docs/user_table.png)

This model will hold the user's details that log in or sign up, there are two types of users the customer and the freelancer both are stored in this table. I could have created a role table and connected it to user to specify the role of the user but I prefer to have one table and double relation when I need both users  to be in the relation. 

looking at the attributes in this table; It stores the basic information about the user like email ,first name and last name, encrypted password, and Bio of the user.

```
class User < ApplicationRecord

  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable

  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
  has_many:user_skills
  has_many:projects
  has_many:freelancer_user_project, class_name: 'Project', foreign_key: 'freelancer_user_id'
  has_many:offers
  has_one_attached:picture
end

```



#### Projects:

![project_table](./docs/project_table.png)

This table will feature all the job details such as:

- User_id– This is the ID of the customer that posted this job.

- Title: a title for the job that can help the freelancer to know what the job is about.

- Price : the amount of money the customer is willing to pay for the job.

- Description – This is a detailed description of the project.

- Budget: the amount of money the customer is willing to pay in the solution the freelancer is providing.

- Freelancer_id: This is the Id of the user that will be working on the job. after the acceptance of the customer on the freelancer offers. 

  Project belongs to a certain user who created it. and has many pictures attached to it, as well as there is a freelancer user who will be working on it when his offer is accepted , Project also has many offers that users can make. and it can have many outcomes 

    

  ```
  class Project < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    has_many_attached:pictures
    belongs_to :freelancer_user, class_name: 'User', optional: true
    has_many :offers
    has_many :project_outcomes
    validates :price, numericality: { only_integer: true ,greater_than:0,less_than:10000, messsage: "%{value} is not a valid size"  }
    validates :title, presence: true
    
  end
  ```

  

#### Offers:

![offers_table](./docs/offers_table.png)

This table will store all proposals/offers, freelancer places offer for a certain project or job so that the customer can view the offers from different freelancers and accept one of them.This table has attributes like:

- User_id– This is the ID of the freelancer that posted the offer.

- Project_id : The id of the project that has the offer.

- accept : a boolean value to mark the offer as accepted when customer accept the offer.

- Message/comment – this is a short message or a comment from the freelancer to the customer.

  Offers as an active record belongs to user and  project where every offer has someone offering it an it  has a project belogning to.

  ```
  class Offer < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :project
  end
  
  ```

  

#### Project Outcomes:

​	This table has all the details of the work the freelancer are doing on the job. It will have values such as:

- Project_id– This is the ID of the project/job that has a current outcome 

- Title : a title for the current stage.

- Details – has the details of the work  from the freelancer to the customer.

- Timestamp :when is this piece of work have been submitted

- Done: a boolean flag to determine if the work has been marked as done and has been paid

  Project outcomes belongs to project where each project outcome has to be related to a certain project.

  ```
  class ProjectOutcome < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :project
  end
  
  ```

#### *For future implementation*

#### *Skills:* 

This table will keep track of the skills needed to complete the job. The customer specifies what kind of skills are needed so that they can be used later on to match with the freelance skills. Also, the user can add skills to his profile.

#### *Skill Level:*

Each skill can be detailed with a level 

#### *Reviews:* 

Table reviews will have all the details of the reviews submitted by the customer on the project the freelancer is working on.

#### *Messages:* 

This table will keep track of the communications between customers and freelancers.

#### 



### R18.Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application

####  Relationships:

##### Project-Project-outcome: one-to-many relationship

where one project has many outcomes and an outcome is related to only one project

![project-outcome-relation](./docs/project-outcome-relation.png)

##### Project-Offer relationship : 

A project can have offers applied to it and any offer has only one project 

![project-offer-relation](./docs/project-offer-relation.png)

##### User-Project relationship :

user has two relationships with the project, User can be a customer who is posting many projects and a project that belongs to one owner, and a user as a freelancer who is working on one project as well as a freelancer can work on. many projects. 

![user-project-relation](./docs/user-project-relation.png)

##### User-Offers relationship :

It is one-to-many relationship where a user as a freelancer can submit many offers and an offer belongs to only one user.

![user-offer-relation](./docs/user-offer-relation.png)

##### User-Project-Outcome relationship :

The user as a freelancer submit many outcomes for a certain project and the outcome belongs to only one freelancer.

### R20.Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project

Scrum framework was elected to build the App. Scrum is an Agile framework that suits projects with unclear tasks, uncertain scope, and definite release dates without compromising the quality. Scrum breaks down the project into time-boxed events ‘The Sprints’. In Scrum, the pieces of code produced are ready-for-production and released incrementally and iteratively. Requirements and tasks are tracked and listed in a Kanban board. For the purpose of this project, the App Trello was used to build the Kanban board.

Project planning:

At the beginning of the project, all the requirements were logged in the Kanban board in a column titled “Product Backlog”. The most detailed requirement `signing in ` is placed at the top of the list, followed by less defined requirements.

The requirements were formatted from a user perspective as “user stories”. Using user stories paints a detailed picture of each requirement, needed functionality, and probable dependencies. The estimated tasks are listed under each user story. More details are added to the subsequent requirements/user stories as more is learned.

Sprint 1:

Before, beginning the sprint a ‘definition of done’ is created. The definition contains all the quality attributes that need to be in the completed work, e.g. a user can signup and log in and log out

The Sprint kicks off with a 2-hour Sprint planning event. Then a ‘Sprint goal’ is established, and the ‘sprint duration’ is estimated, e.g. create a log-in page in 1 days. Then, all the product backlog requirements, related to the sprint goal, are moved to the work in progress column.

Tasks tracking:

Now the Trello board has 3 columns, “product backlog” , Work InProgress, Done. As work progresses, more is known about the product creating more tasks. In the Work-In-Progress, the column contains all the tasks that are currently actioned. This column is narrowed so it does not contain more than three tasks at a time, to enable the effective completion of tasks before moving on to other tasks. The completed tasks are more moved to the ‘done’ column.

As tasks are completed, the released piece of work is checked against the checklist of the ‘definition of done. The work will not be released until it meets all the quality attributes in the checklist.

At the end of the sprint, the unfinished tasks/requirements are moved to the ‘product backlog’ to be done in the next sprints.
